# Aluminium foam modelling
An attempt at using python to generate a Aluminium foam model through a variety of stochastic methods.  
We want to represent a realistic foam such as those supplied for use in solid methane moderators.  

Geometry generation
  random placement of spherical pores
  random placement of non sphereical pores
  various noise based methods

Output formats
 Some MCNP CSG output might be possible for simpler methods,  
 Most likley are some mesh based outputs
 possibly CAD output
